Submission

Students will meet with me prior to the submission of the project. I will give pointers and critique for final product. I will ask a few question about the HTML, CSS & JavaScript code you wrote, so if you copied something from another website without understanding how it works, you'll get caught very easily.

Project Ideas

A photographer / designer and create a website promoting their work.
A website of an organization/association you know or you are involved with.
A website for a music artist / athlete
A hobby or activity you’re interested in.
 

BE CREATIVE WITH THE CONTENT YOU USE. USE OF PERSONAL RECORDED VIDEOS & IMAGES ARE ENCOURAGE.

I'll tell you:

Submitting late. Yes, even 1 min late will result in a 0.
No wireframe. Its like building a house with no blueprint! Measure twice, cut once!
No folder structure! If your folder structure isn't correct, you WILL get a 0. See slide deck 2.1 if your forgot.
