# Final-Project-CodeBridge

This is my final project for the CodeBridge course for Web Development Immersive. 

## Assignment Description:

In this assignment you will act as a consultant to an entity who wants to promote their product. It is your job to use the skills you have learned in order to build a fully functional website designed to promote the product. Be creative, form stories behind the organization; make good use of your skills and donâ€™t be afraid to think outside the box.  The theme of the Web site is decided by the members of your group. Each group will have 2 members, and each member should contribute equally to the project.
